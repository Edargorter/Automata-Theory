# Automata-Theory
Some simulations of theoretical machines (including Finite-State Machines (FSMs)) found in the field of Automata Theory, for educational and empirical scientific purposes.

## Test sets
There is a small (20) set of FSMs and a large (10000) set of FSMs. Each FSM in a test_case file has a corresponding string in the test_strings file, which it either accepts or rejects (TRUE or FALSE).

## Test case schema:
FSMs' descriptions seperated by blank lines, indexed at 0 to correspond with the test strings generated by the same alphabets.
``` 
q_0, q_1                # states of FSM
0, 1                    # alphabet
q_0                     # start
q_0, q_1                # accepting states 
q_0, 0, q_1             # Transitions (|states| x |alphabet| lines)  "from_state, symbol, to_state"
q_0, 1, q_1				
q_1, 0, q_0
q_1, 1, q_1
------------------------ BLANK LINE -----------------------
q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3, ... # Next FSM (indexed 1)
.
.
.

``` 

## Test string schema
Each line contains a boolean and a string, seperated by a space. The boolean on line i (starting at 0) indicates whether the string next to it is accepted by the ith FSM listed above.
```
TRUE string1            # string0 is accepted by FSM indexed at 0
FALSE string2           # string1 is not accepted by FSM indexed at 1
TRUE string3            # string3 is accepted by FSM indexed at 2
TRUE string4            # string4 is accepted by FSM indexed at 3
...
```

## Run
To run finite-automata.py, use
```
./finite-automata.py
```
or, if not set as executable,
```
python3 finite-automata.py
```
The output will end with:
```
9991:   PASS
9992:   PASS
9993:   PASS
9994:   PASS
9995:   PASS
9996:   PASS
9997:   PASS
9998:   PASS
9999:   PASS
2377 / 10000 accept
10000 / 10000 passed
```
indicating that 2377 out of the 10000 strings are accepted by their corresponding FSMs (this could be a sanity check for your own code), and that all cases were matched, i.e. our TRUE/FALSE results matched all those in the string test file.

## Measure time on Linux
```
time ./finite-automata.py
```
Output:
```
2377 out of 10000 accept

real    0m1.974s
user    0m1.889s
sys     0m0.084s
```

## TODO

- Dynamic creation of FSM sprite diagram with animation for string parsing
- Other computational models, pushdown automata, turing machines etc.
